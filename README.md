# Predictive_GAM_seabed_maps
The code and data here support the paper, "Predictive GAM seabed maps can account for defined and fuzzy boundaries to improve accuracy in a Scottish sea loch seascape."

The repository contains three R code files used in the analysis:
(i) model fitting,
(ii) figures, area calculations and
(iii) OOB CV and final figure.

The data files include the 2021 seabed substrata identifications and locations, and the 2022 dataset used for OOB CV.

The GIS files used in the modelling and production of the figures are also included, as well as any GIS files generated in the above script such as slope and aspect and the model outputs generated in script file (i).
